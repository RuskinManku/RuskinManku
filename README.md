### Hey, I am Ruskin ðŸ‘‹
I am a Master's student at Stony Brook University. My research interests lie in the area of NLP and Reinforcement Learning. Currently I am working as a Research Assistant with the NLP group here at Stony Brook. Prior to this, I was a Software Engineer at PayTM, where I had a fun time developing APIs and user-facing services. I have an extensive background in ML, where my research work titled "Local and Global Context-Based Pairwise Models for Sentence Ordering" was published in the estemeed journal, Elsevier Knowledge-Based Systems. I have done many other internship and research projects in ML/NLP as well.

I love chatting and meeting new people so if you ever wanna get in touch drop me a message on any of the platforms mentioned below. Have a nice day!

### Skills 
Here are a few things I've picked up along my learning journey.

Languages: Python(ML/NLP), Java(Web Development), C++(Competitive Programming)

ML Libraries: PyTorch, Hugging Face, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
